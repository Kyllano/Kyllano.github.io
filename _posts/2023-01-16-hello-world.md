Hello everyone, my name is Keylan, but I go by Kyll on the internet and welcome to my blog! I've always been inspired by people making the world a better place by providing help on a multitude of topics and thus, I've decided I should at least give it  atry on topics I love. Not only you might get something out of my ranting, but this lets me leave a mark of what I have been doing and how I might evolve. See it as a personnal diary if you will. An open personnal diary. Not so personnal then, but you get where I'm coming from.

Now that I've given a whole spiel about what I'm doing here, let's talk about who I am and what I do! First off, I'm a student in my 3rd year of computer science at The University of Paul Sabatier III in Toulouse. I specifically study about networking and I aspire to get into Computer security because it's really fun and it combine about every field of computer science (Networking, Software engineering, Embedded Systems, Mathematics etc.). 

But enough about work, let's talk about what I do for fun and what I'm passionate about. I really LOVE submarine wildlife and more specifically, I adore shrimps. I love them so much that I have 3 of them at home with 2 endler guppies. Here is one of my shrimp named kitty cat. At the time, she was berried (which means she had eggs).

This means I might talk about shrimp caring in the future. I also enjoy learning new things. The last topic I have been learning about is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My next post will probably be about that and how to make an AI using fastai (I've been learning AI thanks to Jeremy Howard's course and book. You can find these for free at his website [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)). I have already created and deployed my first AI, it's a [shrimp classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kyllano/ShrimpClassifier) which can tell the difference between sexy shrimp, vampire shrimp, cleaner shrimp and red cherry shrimp with over 97% accuracy (error rate is about 0.0263)

Other than AI, I also have an interest in the video gaming industry. I have _some_ experience with gamedev as I have created in the past a Unity railshooter game set in a spaceship/alien/anti-xeno scenario. Sadly this was before COVID so I was younger and had no idea about what keeping a backlog meant and just lost the game once it was finished (probably due to a computer change or an OS change I don't know really) and I never thought about publishing it to itch.io. It's sad because I had a whole low poly map and low poly spaceship made by hand in Blender and made the music myself (I would not listen to it on loop but the electro sounds were fitting of the alien setting). Hopefully in the future, I'll find another game project I'm passionate about and I'll post about it here (probably in Godo this time sinc it looks way cooler than Unity for a number of reason)

I also enjoy playing games and understanding what mechanics makes the game fun and the thought that goes behind every elements of gameplay. So I also might talk about what soe games do right and what some games do wring (if I was to give a quick example, I love how Ultrakill and Doom health mechanic work. You can heal by killing ennemies, so the games forces you to play the game for you to win. Moreover it forces you to have reflexes and play in smart/skilled ways or the punishement is losing and retrying. That is in contrast of other games such as Destiny in which their healing process consist of just hiding and witing for you to heal)

Another source of fun that I enjoy is music. Indeed I've been playing piano for the better part of my life(since I was 6 years old to be exact) and guitar for about 3 years now, so I might be posting music sheets or rant on topics about music theory and other music subjects.

Anyway, I hope that you will find something interesting in this website and that you'll learn maybe a thing or two. If you also have something interesting to tell me or want to ask a question, my discord DMs are open (Kyll#2689) ! Don't hesitate to come talk to me about anything r just to come say hi! ðŸ˜Š

I'll see you around !

Kyll
