My name is Keylan, but I go by Kyll on the internet. Oh and by the way, welcome to my blog! I've always been inspired by people making the world a better place by providing help on a multitude of topics and thus, I've decided I should at least give it  atry on topics I love. Not only you might get something out of my ranting, but this lets me leave a mark of what I have been doing and how I might evolve. See it as a personnal diary if you will. An open personnal diary. Not so personnal then, but you get where I'm coming from.

Now that I've given a whole spiel about what I'm doing here, let's talk about who I am and what I do! First off, I'm a student in my 3rd year of computer science at The University of Paul Sabatier III in Toulouse. I specifically study about networking and I aspire to get into Computer security because it's really fun and it combine about every field of computer science (Networking, Software engineering, Embedded Systems, Mathematics etc.). 

But enough about work, let's talk about what I do for fun and what I'm passionate about. I really LOVE submarine wildlife and more specifically, I adore shrimps. I love them so much that I have 3 of them at home with 2 endler guppies.
